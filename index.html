  <title>Welcome to Alison's Website!</title>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>My name is Alison Meines and I am a third year, dual masters student (Master of Public Affairs through SPEA and Master of Library Science through Luddy). I am originally from Elmendorf, Texas, and currently live in Bedford, Indiana with my husband. We have a miniature Schnauzer named Indy, a bearded dragon named Tad, and our flock of backyard chickens. When I'm not reading/studying/writing papers, I am normally spending time outside or trying to perfect my coffee pour-over technique for a stellar cup of coffee.</p>

<p>Prior to grad school I worked as an Intelligence Specialist in the United States Navy. Since moving to Indiana, I've had the opportunity to learn home renovation skills, how to conduct research in grad school, and most importantly, how to layer accordingly during Midwest winters. I enjoy practicing yoga and plan on completing yoga teacher training sometime in the near future. I truly enjoy learning and look forward to acquiring new website creation skills in this class.
