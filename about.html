<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>
</p>I am originally from South Texas. My family still lives and works in and around the San Antonio area. My husband is originally from Michigan (we met in the Navy), and his family lives and works around the Grand Rapids area. He moved to Indiana when he was about 10 years old, so he claims both states as home (except in football - he is a diehard Detroit Lions fan!). It a little sad to have our families so far away on opposite sides of the country, but it's pretty fun to experience completely different sceneries when we visit them. Especially this time of year, which is when the San Antonio Stock Show and Rodeo is in full swing!

<p>I became interested in yoga back in 2007 when I took a yoga class for my undergrad physical education requirement. I genuinely enjoyed how it was more than physical activity but also a great way to practice mindfulness and an opportunity to stimulate mental awareness. I continued practicing on and off throughout the years, especially when I was living in different cities and could visit new yoga environments. One of my favorites was taking a yoga class while on a stand-up paddle board in San Diego - talk about a work out!
</p>

<p>While in the Navy, I was stationed in Virginia, Florida, and California. I also worked for a short time at the United States Embassy in Bogota, Colombia. My favorite thing about living in different places was finding the best places to eat! I love traveling, and I hope to visit more places (both nationally and internationally) in the near future. The top three places I want to visit next are Iceland, Japan, and India. But before I leave the states, I have to stop by Texas first to say hello to my family and grab some BBQ!
