<h1>Alison Meines</h1>
<h2>My Interests</h2>
<p>I moved to Bedford, Indiana in late 2021 after my husband and I got out of the military. I like to spend time outdoors, especially kayaking up and down the Salt Creek with my dog, Indy. My hobbies include learning to grow and preserving fruits and vegetables, caring for our backyard chickens, practicing yoga, playing Doom (my favorite video game), and going on food adventures to find new restaurants and coffee shops around the Bedford and Bloomington areas that I've never tried before.</p>
